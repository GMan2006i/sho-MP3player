<!-- YOU CAN COPY ALL THIS DIRECTLY INTO GOOGLE PAGES AND WHATNOT AS PAGE SOURCE (Embed > Embed Code) -->

<audio autoplay loop controls id="x" src="" > </audio>
<!-- edit these parts above (loop, controls, etc) to change the way the player works.-->
<!-- 'src=""' is the url of the audio you are playing. I recommend putting your audio on a github repo, making it into a github pages page, and then using the direct link of the audio in the 'src=""' chunk -->

<script>
  var audio = document.getElementById("x");
  audio.volume = 1; //audio.volume is the default volume. its percent based, 0.00-1.00.
